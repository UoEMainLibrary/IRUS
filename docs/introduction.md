# DSpace IRUS-UK patch

## Introduction

[IRUS (Institutional Repository Usage Statistics)](http://www.irus.mimas.ac.uk/) enables UK Institutional Repositories (IRs) to share and expose statistics based on the COUNTER standard. It provides a nation-wide view of UK repository usage to benefit organisations such as [Jisc](https://www.jisc.ac.uk/), offers opportunities for benchmarking and acts as an intermediary between UK repositories and other agencies.

IRUS-UK collects raw usage data from UK IRs and processes these data into COUNTER-compliant statistics. This provides repositories with comparable, authoritative, standards-based data.

IRUS-UK is being developed by a consortium involving [Jisc](https://www.jisc.ac.uk/), [Cranfield University](https://www.cranfield.ac.uk/) and [Evidence Base](http://www.bcu.ac.uk/evidence-base).

This patch integrates the IRUS-UK service with DSpace. It allows for automated logging of Bitstream downloads and Item views to IRUS-UK.

The DSpace IRUS-UK patch has been developed and is maintained by [Atmire](https://www.atmire.com), a registered service provider for DSpace.
